# Supply Chain implementation with Etherium Blockchain

This is our Hackathon Project for HackBash 2021.

## Abstract
Our idea is to apply the blockchain concept in the Supply Chain industry. In a way that creates transparency in the authenticity of the original product manufacturer creating the trusted environment cleaning the fake / pirated products from the market. We are going to implement a distributed solution in which from the manufacturer of the product to all the suppliers in the chain will be recorded in the blockchain creating an open market for end-user to verify the legitimacy of the product.

## Progress
We have developed the implementation of supply chain process in Etherium Smart contract. Which has following options:
- Manufacturer - Can add a Product
- Supplier - Can add state / position to given product
- Customer - Can see the product details by quering the blockchain

## Technologies or Tools used
- Ganache - for local Personal Etherium Blockchain testing
- Remix - http://remix.ethereum.org/ for writing, compiling and deploying our smart contract
- MetaMask - for providing the access of local blockchain hosted with Ganache to browser based Remix platform
- Frontend - for user interaction, made in HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Frontend

## Next Phase
Right now for testing purpose, all the actions like add_product, add_product_state are open without any authentication of menufacturer and supplier. Our next phase is to implement login & registraction system so that only regsitered menufacturer & supplier can add the information to the blockchain.

## Future Plan
There is one roadmap we have seen on one Medium article by Zebi,

By studying this diagram we have built a json representation of blockchain for each transaction in above process.
Like for example, the transaction between Menufacturer & Supplier will consists of following data:
( This transaction generally consists of one type of products from menufacturers to supplier )
- menufacturer detail
- supplier detail

- batch_id
- batch_product_number_from
- batch_product_number_to
- product_count
- product details
- menufecturing cost
- sell price
- certificate of origin
- weight

- dispatch from location
- dispatch to location
- batch dispatch date
- batch received date

The transaction between Supplier & Logistics will consists of following data:
( This transaction generally consists of many type of products collected from many menufacturers to be shipped to one location per transaction )
- supplier detail
- logistics detail

- order_id
- detail of one type of products collected from many menufacturers combined togather
- purchased cost from manufacturer
- sell price
- weight

- dispatch from location
- dispatch to location
- batch dispatch date
- batch received date

If we move further, logistics will arrange the orders of many suppliers and fit them in containers to be shipped through Shipping line. Which will then be received at the receiver port and further distributed to local supplier and end user.
But the data generated by this is detailed and can be tracked at each stage of the supply chain. This system can take some time to build but is Robust on which supplychain and import export businesses can join into.
